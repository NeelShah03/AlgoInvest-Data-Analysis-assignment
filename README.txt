# Sales Data Analysis Report

## Insights

1. Data Overview:
   - The sales data covers multiple products over a period of time.
   - Key metrics include OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, Price, and Order Date.

2. Total Sales:
   - We calculated the total sales value for the entire dataset.
   - This gives us an overview of the company's overall performance.

3. High Performing Products:
   - We identified the top 3 products with the highest total sales value.
   - This insight can guide inventory management and marketing strategies.

4. Monthly Growth:
   - We analyzed month-over-month sales growth.
   - This helps in understanding seasonal trends and overall business trajectory.

5. Data Quality:
   - The dataset required cleaning for missing values and duplicates.
   - This emphasizes the importance of data quality in analysis.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. Database Connection:
   - Challenge: Initial connection issues with MySQL database.
   - Solution: Properly URL-encoded the password and corrected the connection string format.

2. Table Structure:
   - Challenge: The 'YearMonth' column didn't exist in the MySQL table.
   - Solution: Implemented a check-and-add approach to ensure the column exists before data insertion.

3. SQL Syntax:
   - Challenge: 'IF NOT EXISTS' clause not supported in ALTER TABLE statement for MySQL.
   - Solution: Wrote a custom check using information_schema to verify column existence before adding.

4. Data Insertion:
   - Challenge: Ensuring all transformed data, including new columns, are properly inserted into MySQL.
   - Solution: Used SQLAlchemy's to_sql method with appropriate parameters for smooth data transfer.

5.Complex SQL Query for Monthly Growth:
   - Challenge: Calculating the month-over-month growth in sales and showing percentage growth month by month proved to be particularly difficult.
   - Solution: Developed a complex SQL query using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions. The query involved:
     a) Grouping sales by month
     b) Using the LAG function to get the previous month's sales
     c) Calculating the percentage growth using these values
   This solution required a deep understanding of SQL and careful testing to ensure accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the importance of data cleaning, transformation, and proper database management in conducting meaningful business analysis. By overcoming various technical challenges, we were able to extract valuable insights about product performance and sales trends. These insights can be used to inform business strategies, inventory management, and sales forecasting.

Future improvements could include automating the data pipeline for regular updates and expanding the analysis to include more advanced metrics and visualizations.
